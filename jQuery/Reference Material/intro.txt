/*This file gives basic information about basic jQuery syntax*/

jQuery uses $() to select elements and specific classes.
In order to select a specific class. 
Example: in order to select a class called "nav", we'd use $('.nav') to select it. 

There is a way to also create new elements using the same selector by adding <> around the element. 
Example: We want to create a new li element, we'd use the following...
$('<li>')

There is a .text() method that can be used to manipulate the text of an element in a webpage. This is where the selectors become handy. If we create a new element and pass in a string as the parameter, the element will be created with the text inside.
Example:
$('<p>').text('This is stuff') 
^^^Creates a paragraph with the text "This is stuff"^^^
The same concept applies to existing elements. If there are existing elements and method is passed a string, all of the elements' text will be overwritten with the string that is passed in as a parameter. 
If there isn't a string passed as a parameter into the .text() method, it will return the text of all of the elements of the type that was selected.
Example:
$('p').text()
^^^This returns the text of all 'p' elements^^^

***Use .val() instead of .text() when dealing with forms(sections where user inputs data)***

The .appendTo() method can be used to create new elements that will be added to a specific block. It can be used in tandem with the .text() method to add the element with text to create the element all in one line of code. It will add the new element to the end of the set.
On the other hand, there is the .prependTo() method which is essentially the same as the .appendTo() method with the only exception that it adds elements to the beginning of the set instead of the end.

.remove() [as the name implies] will remove an element from a set.

Additional methods:
.hide() an element
.show() an element
.toggle() hide/show an element

.addClass() add CSS class to an element
.removeClass() removes CSS class to an element
.toggleClass() add/remove CSS class to an element





Using the DOM, there are methods that allow the traversal of elements.
.next() gets the next sibling of the selected element
.prev() gets the previous sibling of the selected element
.children() gets the children of the selected element
^^^Giving a selected element (i.e. $('p'))as a parameter gets a specific child





Effects:
.slideDown() slides an element down where the parameter is the number of milliseconds it takes the animation to finish
.slideUp() is the same concept as .slideDown()

***.fade methods take milliseconds as a parameter like .slide methods***

.fadeIn() fades from white canvas to the image
.fadeOut() fades from image to white canvas 

***.animate is more custom than .slide and .fade***
.animate() takes two parameters (css property, duration of animation/change)
