/*This file gives basic information about basic jQuery syntax*/

jQuery uses $() to select elements and specific classes.
In order to select a specific class. 
Example: in order to select a class called "nav", we'd use $('.nav') to select it. 

There is a way to also create new elements using the same selector by adding <> around the element. 
Example: We want to create a new li element, we'd use the following...
$('<li>')

There is a .text() method that can be used to manipulate the text of an element in a webpage. This is where the selectors become handy. If we create a new element and pass in a string as the parameter, the element will be created with the text inside.
Example:
$('<p>').text('This is stuff') 
^^^Creates a paragraph with the text "This is stuff"^^^
The same concept applies to existing elements. If there are existing elements and method is passed a string, all of the elements' text will be overwritten with the string that is passed in as a parameter. 
If there isn't a string passed as a parameter into the .text() method, it will return the text of all of the elements of the type that was selected.
Example:
$('p').text()
^^^This returns the text of all 'p' elements^^^
