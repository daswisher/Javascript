/*This file gives basic information about basic jQuery syntax*/

jQuery uses $() to select elements and specific classes.
In order to select a specific class. 
Example: in order to select a class called "nav", we'd use $('.nav') to select it. 

There is a way to also create new elements using the same selector by adding <> around the element. 
Example: We want to create a new li element, we'd use the following...
$('<li>')
