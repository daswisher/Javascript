//Strings are made be using either single or double quotes
//'' vs ""
var string1 = 'This is a string';
var string2 = "This is also a string";

//There are methods that can be used on strings (i.e .length)
var string1Length = string1.length;
//The line above takes the length (characters and spaces) of string1 and stores it in a new variable called string1Length
